# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal projects portfolio! This repository serves as a collection of projects that I've worked on as I journey into the fascinating world of data science and machine learning. Each project showcases my skills, knowledge, and passion for this field.

## About Me

I am Dru Rainer, a senior computer science student at Spring Hill College with a keen interest in data science and machine learning. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to solve real-world problems and make informed decisions. Through continuous learning and hands-on projects, I'm honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and predictive modeling.

## Projects

### Project 1: Porting SONiC to an Unsupported Network Switch 

- Description: Completed an individual project while working with an active research team at my internship with the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon. I was focused on porting SONiC network operating system to a previously unsupported platform through rigorous hands-on testing. I cannot disclose specifics or show code due to an NDA but I will disclose some of the accomplishments from the project. Devised a methodology for conducting research incrementally. Reverse engineered multiple configuration modules in C, Python, Kernel. Developed hardware utility modules. Implemented Sonic Platform for unsupported hardware. Constructed plugin files to enable expected outputs. Resolved compatibility issues through rigorous testing and troubleshooting. Enhanced interface functionality with build machine. Prepared and presented weekly technical briefs. Maintained transparent roadmap and progress updates with team leadership.
- Technologies Used: SONiC, Linux, Debian, Docker, Git, 

### Project 2: Arduino Computer Vision 

- Description: Computer vision project using Arduino Uno and an OV7670 camera module. The project aims to demonstrate basic image processing tasks on Arduino, such as edge detection and object tracking. 

- Technologies Used: Arduino Uno, OV7670 camera module
- Source Code Link: ArduinoVision.cpp
